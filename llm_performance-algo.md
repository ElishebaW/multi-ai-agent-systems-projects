Dijkstra's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest paths from a given source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of Dijkstra's Algorithm with a Java implementation as you provided:

1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list, where each vertex has a list of its neighboring edges.

2. **Source Vertex Selection**: You start with the source vertex (in this case, 0)), and initialize its distance to 0.

3. **Priority Queue Management**: A priority queue is used to maintain a sorted list of vertices based on their current shortest distance from the source.

4. **Vertex Processing**: For each vertex in the priority queue:

   - Check if the vertex has been visited (visited flag).
   - If not visited, calculate its new shortest distance by adding the weight of the edge connecting it with the current minimum.
   - Update the vertex's shortest distance and add an entry to the vertex's adjacency list with the new neighbor and its weight.
   - Mark the vertex as visited.

5. **Priority Queue Management (Re)**: After all vertices have been processed, the priority queue may contain unvisited vertices. This step is optional but can be useful to find any remaining shortest paths.

6. **Result Output**: Finally, you output the shortest distances from each vertex to the source vertex (0 in this case). In your example, you would print out the shortest paths for all pairs of vertices.

Now that we have gone through the complete steps of Dijkstra's Algorithm with a Java implementation, you can use this code as a starting point for any similar graph traversal problem.
