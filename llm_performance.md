Dijkstra’s algorithm is a famous graph search algorithm used for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It was developed by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1959.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown of Dijkstra's Algorithm

1. **Initialization**: The algorithm begins by initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity and the distance to the starting node (also known as the source node) as zero.
2. **Create a Priority Queue**: A priority queue is created, where each element is a pair consisting of the node and its current shortest distance from the source node. This ensures that the node with the shortest distance will always be the first one extracted from the queue.
3. **Extract the Node with Minimum Distance**: The algorithm extracts the node with the minimum distance from the priority queue. This node is known as the current node.
4. **Update Distances of Neighbors**: For each neighbor of the current node that has not been visited yet, the algorithm updates its distance by adding the weight of the edge connecting it to the current node and keeping track of the previous node in the shortest path.
5. **Mark Neighbor as Visited**: After updating the distances of neighbors, the algorithm marks each of them as visited by changing their distance to infinity (since we know that the shortest distance has already been found).
6. **Repeat Steps 3-5**: The algorithm repeats steps 3-5 until all nodes in the graph have been visited.

### Java Implementation Using Llama 3.2

```java
import java.util.*;

// Define a class to represent a node in the graph
class Node {
    String name;
    int distance;

    public Node(String name, int distance) {
        this.name = name;
        this.distance = distance;
    }
}

public class Dijkstra {
    // Define the main function to execute Dijkstra's algorithm
    public static void dijkstra(HashMap<String, HashMap<String, Integer>> graph, String source) {
        // Initialize distances and previous nodes in shortest path
        Map<String, Integer> distances = new HashMap<>();
        Map<String, String> previous = new HashMap<>();

        for (String node : graph.keySet()) {
            distances.put(node, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        }
        distances.put(source, 0);

        // Create a priority queue to store nodes based on their current shortest distance
        PriorityQueue<Node> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a.distance - b.distance);
        pq.add(new Node(source, 0));

        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            Node currentNode = pq.poll();

            for (String neighbor : graph.get(currentNode.name).keySet()) {
                int weight = graph.get(currentNode.name).get(neighbor);
                int distance = currentNode.distance + weight;

                if (distance < distances.get(neighbor)) {
                    distances.put(neighbor, distance);
                    previous.put(neighbor, currentNode.name);

                    pq.add(new Node(neighbor, distance));
                }
            }
        }

        // Print shortest distances from source node
        System.out.println("Shortest distances:");
        for (String node : distances.keySet()) {
            if (!node.equals(source)) {
                System.out.println(node + ": " + distances.get(node));
            }
        }

        // Build shortest path using previous nodes
        System.out.println("Previous nodes in shortest path:");
        buildPath(previous, source);
    }

    // Function to print the shortest path from source node
    public static void buildPath(Map<String, String> previous, String source) {
        StringBuilder path = new StringBuilder();
        String currentNode = source;

        while (currentNode != null) {
            path.insert(0, currentNode + " -> ");
            currentNode = previous.get(currentNode);
        }

        System.out.println(path.toString());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define the graph as a HashMap of adjacency lists
        HashMap<String, HashMap<String, Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        graph.put("A", Map.of("B", 1, "C", 4));
        graph.put("B", Map.of("A", 1, "D", 2, "E", 5));
        graph.put("C", Map.of("A", 4, "F", 3));
        graph.put("D", Map.of("B", 2, "E", 1));
        graph.put("E", Map.of("B", 5, "D", 1, "F", 1));
        graph.put("F", Map.of("C", 3, "E", 1));

        // Execute Dijkstra's algorithm with source node as 'A'
        dijkstra(graph, "A");
    }
}
```

This Java code implements Dijkstra’s algorithm using a priority queue to efficiently find the shortest path between nodes in a graph. The `dijkstra` function initializes distances and previous nodes in the shortest path for each node, then iteratively updates these values until all nodes have been visited. Finally, it prints the shortest distances from the source node and builds the corresponding shortest path using the `buildPath` function.

When run, this program defines a sample graph with five nodes ('A' to 'F') and six edges between them. It then executes Dijkstra's algorithm starting from node 'A', printing the shortest distance to each reachable node and the previous node in the shortest path.
